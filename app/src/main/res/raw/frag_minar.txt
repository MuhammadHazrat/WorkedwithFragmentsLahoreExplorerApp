Minar-e-Pakistan (Urdu: مینارِ پاکستان‎) is a national monument located in Lahore, Pakistan.[1] The tower was built between 1960 and 1968 on the site where the All-India Muslim League passed the Lahore Resolution on 23 March 1940 - the first official call for a separate and independent homeland for the Muslims of British India, as espoused by the two-nation theory.

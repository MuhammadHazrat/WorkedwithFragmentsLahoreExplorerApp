Founded in 1865 during the British colonial period, Lahore Museum is now one of Pakistan’s most visited and highly regarded museums. The museum, along with the Zamzama Gun located directly in front of the building, were made famous in the celebrated British novel Kim, written by Rudyard Kipling - whose father was one of the museum’s earliest curators.
